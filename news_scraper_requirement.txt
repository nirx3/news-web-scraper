     News Aggregator Project
==============================

Objective:
----------
Create a Python web scraper that collects news articles from multiple websites,
extracts key information, and performs basic sentiment analysis.

Requirements:
-------------
1. Sources:
   - Scrape at least 3 different news websites (e.g., BBC, CNN, TechCrunch).
   - Handle different HTML structures per site.

2. Data Extraction:
   For each article, capture:
   - Headline/Title
   - Author (if available)
   - Publication date
   - Summary or first 200 words
   - URL

3. Filtering:
   - Only scrape articles from the last 7 days.
   - Allow filtering by keywords (e.g., "AI", "Space", "Economy").

4. Data Storage:
   - Save data in both CSV and JSON formats.

5. Sentiment Analysis:
   - Analyze headline/summary to classify sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
   - Use TextBlob, NLTK, or any other Python library.

6. Automation & Scheduling:
   - Script should be able to run daily and append new articles to existing files.

7. Optional Extras:
   - Generate daily report: top 5 positive & negative headlines.
   - Provide a simple plot showing sentiment trends over time.

Console Output Expectations:
----------------------------
- Show progress per source, e.g., "[âœ“] BBC: 12 articles found"
- Display total articles processed
- Show sentiment distribution: Positive | Neutral | Negative
- Provide a summary report of top headlines
- Optional: color coding for sentiment (green/positive, red/negative, yellow/neutral)

Skill Level:
------------
Intermediate Python, web scraping, data processing, and basic sentiment analysis.

Notes:
------
- Start with one website first if needed, then expand to multiple sources.
- Focus on clean console output and well-structured saved files.
